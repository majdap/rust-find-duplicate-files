# DupeFind

This CLI utility was created for internal use at my previous job, to find files with duplicate names across our code base. The codebase was a large Angular monorepo with multiple sub-projects whcih lead to many duplicate file names. I am currently working on making this util more generic to allow for more flexibility and customisation.
